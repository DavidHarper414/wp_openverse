    ignore:distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead:DeprecationWarning
# Reasons for filtering warnings
#   "sqlalchemy.exc.MovedIn20Warning" ==> this warning indicates that a particular functionality has been moved within the library and the warning is raised to inform the users about the change. But in this case it is not of use so we filtered this warning to make the output less cluttered
#   "Calling `DAG.create_dagrun\(\)` without an explicit data interval is deprecated:airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning" ==>To avoid unnecessary noise in the test output, this deprecation warning is ignored because it is expected and does not indicate a problem with the tests themselves.
#   "*is deprecated and will be (remoevd|removed) in Flask 2.3.:DeprecationWarning" ==> this warning is not important in user's prespective and testing purposes so it is filtered to make the output lesss cluttered
#   "distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead:DeprecationWarning" ==> The distutils library, which is a component of the Python standard library, is the subject of this warning. The packaging.version module is advised over using the Version classes from Distutils, which are listed as being deprecated. The deprecation warning is disregarded in order to maintain a clear and focused test output because it is unrelated to the tests being run.
