  ignore:Unverified HTTPS request
# Ignore warnings related to unverified HTTPS requests.
# Reason: This warning is suppressed to avoid raising warnings when making HTTP requests
# to servers with invalid or self-signed SSL certificates. It allows the tests to proceed
# without being interrupted by these warnings.
  ignore:The default value of USE_TZ will change from False to True in Django 5.0
# Ignore warnings about the upcoming change in the default value of 'USE_TZ' setting in Django 5.0.
# Reason: The reason this warning is suppressed is actually because we already set USE_TZ to True. Since no changes are required on our part, we can safely ignore this to declutter the logs.
