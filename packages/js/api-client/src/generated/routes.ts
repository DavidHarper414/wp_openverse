   * Return audio files that match the query.
   *
   * This endpoint allows you to search within specific fields, or to retrieve
   * a collection of all audio files from a specific source, creator or tag.
   * Results are paginated on the basis of the `page` parameter. The `page_size`
   * parameter controls the total number of pages.
   *
   * Although there may be millions of relevant records, only the most relevant
   * or the most recent several thousand records can be viewed. This is by design:
   * the search endpoint should be used to find the top 10,000 most relevant
   * results, not for exhaustive search or bulk download of every barely relevant
   * result. As such, the caller should not try to access pages beyond `page_count`,
   * or else the server will reject the query.
   *
   * ### Default search
   * The **default search** allows users to find media based on a query string.
   * It supports a wide range of optional filters to narrow down search results
   * according to specific needs.
   *
   * By default, this endpoint performs a full-text search for the value of `q` parameter.
   * You can search within the `creator`, `title` or `tags` fields by omitting
   * the `q` parameter and using one of these field parameters.
   * These results can be filtered by `source`, `excluded_source`, `license`, `license_type`, `creator`, `tags`, `title`, `filter_dead`, `extension`, `mature`, `unstable__include_sensitive_results`, `category` and `length`.
   *
   * The default search results are sorted by relevance.
   *
   * ### Collection search
   * The collection search allows to retrieve a collection of media from a specific source,
   * creator or tag. The `unstable__collection` parameter is used to specify the type of collection to retrieve.
   *
   * - `unstable__collection=tag&unstable__tag=tagName` will return the media with tag `tagName`.
   * - `unstable__collection=source&source=sourceName` will return the media from source `sourceName`.
   * - `unstable__collection=creator&creator=creatorName&source=sourceName` will return the media by creator `creatorName` at `sourceName`.
   *
   * Collection results are sorted by the time they were added to Openverse, with the most recent
   * additions appearing first. The filters such as `license` are not available for collections.
